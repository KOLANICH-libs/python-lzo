##A simple and sometimes naive python lzo library.

This is a python library deals with lzo files compressed with lzop.





Known issues:
crc32 checksum not supported, because no such function in minilzo library
filter not supported, but version number not current
path name not supported
mtime read but not set


TODO:
check if liblzo presents. Use it if so, otherwise use builtin minilzo
figure out why signature check fails like lzop does
